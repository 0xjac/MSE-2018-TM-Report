The Ethereum blockchain wants to move from a Proof-of-Work consensus protocol to
a Proof-fo-Stake one. Correct-by-Construction Casper proposes an abstract family
of Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols in a mathematical sense but does not
provide block production strategies for nodes. This project aims to propose some
basic strategies as well as a model to compare them. A testing framework based
on an existing Casper library has been implemented in order to simulate
blockchains ruled by the proposed basic strategies. Latency, number of nodes and
overhead have been measured during the simulations.
The implemented framework has been validated using the basic strategies and
permits the implementation of more complex ones through a generic code
architecture. The proposed model offers a good way to compare latency and
overhead for strategies but is not efficient to evaluate the way a strategy scales
with the number of nodes in the network.
