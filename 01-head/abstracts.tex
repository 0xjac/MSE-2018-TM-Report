The Ethereum blockchain is meant to move from a Proof-of-Work consensus protocol
to a Proof-of-Stake one. Correct-by-Construction Casper delivers an abstract
family of mathematical Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols but does not provide
block production strategies for nodes which this project aims to cater to and
compare them. A testing framework based on an existing Casper library has been
implemented in order to simulate blockchains ruled by the proposed basic
strategies and latency, node count and overhead were measured during the
simulations.  The implemented framework has been validated using the basic
strategies and permits the implementation of more complex ones through a generic
code architecture. The proposed model offers a good way to compare latency and
overhead for strategies but is not efficient to evaluate the way a strategy
scales with the number of nodes in the network.
