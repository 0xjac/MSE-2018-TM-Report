This project's target is to setup a methodology to compare block building
stratgies for a \gls{cbc} Casper protocol particularly for blockchain use. The
project results in a comparator framework based on a core library implementing
the \gls{cbc} Casper blockchain abstract structure which is generic enough to
allow the implementation of new block building strategies, network topologies,
and improved termination conditions. 
The framework oversees three variables for comparison: latency, number of nodes,
and overhead; due to their explicit relative performances through core
strategies, the framework is valid.
After adapting the model to achieve target performances for each strategy, a new
model is proposed. This model shows a better means of comparison though still
lacking when estimating the scaling of the number of nodes for different
strategies despite this variable's lesser impact on the Trilemma model.

Future improvements include: modeling using the number of nodes variable in a
different way, modeling in a network topology implementation that reflects a
real-life setting, and dipping into ``bottom-up'' strategies that are more
likely to be implemented on a deployed blockchain. Furthermore, data that has been
generated with other sending strategies have not been analyzed yet and could be
used to optimize the current model.
